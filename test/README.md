# Sikky test suite

## Running the tests

To run the test suite in-browser, fire up a development server...

```bash
# run `npm run browser` if you haven't already
npm run browser
```

...then open `port 8080` in your browser. This will open Mocha test page and run the entire browser test suite.

To run the test suite on the command line (`node.js` tests *and* browser tests, via Chrome):

```bash
nom run test:browser
```

To run `node.js` tests on the command line:

```bash
npm run test:node
```

## If in doubt...

...ask!
