# Omni

Omni is an app for playing and learning about musical scales.

I've picked 40 of my favourites which can be played by swiping the keys at the bottom. Each scale is simply a collection of tones that can be played in different key signatures and I've included a short blurb about each one. They have roots from cultures all around the world and some have been in existence for over 50,000 years. The pitch constellation circle will tell you where the tones are situated within an octave.

Strum the harp, play with 5 effects using the XY pad, mix key signatures, add bass harmonies and record/download your own loops.
